Calculator

This program is like a simple, friendly calculator you can use right in your computer's terminal. It lets you do basic math problems one after another.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does in a nutshell:

It greets you and then waits for you to type in a number, an operation (+, -, *, /), and a second number.

After you press Enter, it solves the problem you entered and shows you the result.

It's smart enough to catch mistakes, like if you try to divide a number by zero or accidentally type a letter instead of a number.

It keeps running and asking for new calculations until you tell it you're done.

Essentially, it's a great example of a program that can talk to the user, make decisions based on their input, and handle potential errors all in one place.
